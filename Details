#This code is meant to run in the background to monitor the internal temperature and battery of the PC, giving 
#warnings to the user, and shutting down when critical levels are met.

#note: I couldn't use a list of strings with low_battery power for some reason using 'if battery in list'.

#Also, since I only have a virtual machine for linux, inxi was not able to track the temperature of my actual pc. So
#the first part is purely guessing based on the examples on the web. If ti does not work, the field number might be 
where to look
